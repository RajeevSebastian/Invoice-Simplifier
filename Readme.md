# 272-Project

Project Idea 1:
1. Project Title - Roommate and Apartment recommendation system.

2. Project idea description - International students face a lot of difficulties both before and after reaching here, finding like minded roommates and apartments being the most prominent ones. Our project will try to solve both these problems by collecting past data related to these fields, analysing the data to find out traits and training a ML algorithm to make recommendations for the students.

3. Goal of the project (who are your developing the project for) - International students

4. Technology stack - 
    a. Frontend - Html5, CSS3, Javascript, ReactJS.
    b. Backend - springboot / nodejs
    c. Data collection and processing - Google forms, python and python packages like numpy, pandas, matplotlib and scikit-learn.
    
    
Project Idea 2:
1. Project Title - Intership and fulltime job recommendation system.

2. Project idea description - This is yet another aspect of MS in US (undergrauates as well) that students worry about. So, to make the process a little bit easy for the students, we will analyse their resume, pick up their skill sets and using these data we will recommend prospective careers.

    c. Data collection and processing - Google forms, IBM Db2 Augmented Data Explorer for picking up keywords, python and python packages like numpy, pandas, matplotlib and scikit-learn.


Project Idea 3:
1. Project Title - Technology recommendation system.

2. Project idea description - Developing a software requires use of a lot of different technologies. Choosing the right technologies can boost up the efficiency of the project to a whole new level. Amateur, intermidiate and even expert developers put in a lot of time to research about available technologies and weigh the pros and cons. Through our project we plan to reduce this effort and make technology choosing a seamless experience. Once the user logs in and put in few details about the project he is going to start and his personal proficiency regarding other softwares, our system will recommend him with different technologies he can use to handle different aspects of his project.
